# Urban-Scaling-Laws-2006
# We introduce an open-source web platform we have developed to enable users to view and compare the radial profiles of land artificialization for 305 major European cities in 2006.

We adopt a specific analytical approach to better understand the phenomenon of land artificialization and its spatialization. We use the comparative analysis of the evolution of land use in the largest European cities, focusing on the center-periphery organization. 

The main result of this work is that the center-periphery organization of artifcial land use successions occurs at the same rate if we cancel out the size effect of urban areas.
